I hope this document finds you well. In this project, I have been working on analyzing Airbnb listings data to predict rental prices using machine learning techniques. I have conducted exploratory data analysis, cleaned and preprocessed the data, and built various machine learning models to predict rental prices.

As you review my project, I kindly ask you to take note of the following aspects:

GitHub Pages: Please visit the project's GitHub Pages site at https://argrabowski.github.io/CS_539_Final_Project/ for an overview of the project, including visualizations and analysis.

Data Preprocessing and cleaning: Please review my data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure that I have correctly handled missing values, dealt with outliers, and prepared the data for machine learning models.

Exploratory Data Analysis: The project includes exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns or relationships between features. Please evaluate the project based on the quality and relevance of the visualizations and analysis presented.

Feature Engineering: Please review my feature engineering steps, including how I encoded categorical variables using one-hot and ordinal encoders, and how I standardized numerical variables using standard scalar.

Model Selection and Evaluation: Please review my model selection and evaluation steps, including how I split the data into training and testing sets, how I used cross-validation to select the best hyperparameters, and how I evaluated the performance of the models using various metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R-squared.

Code Quality and Documentation: Please review the quality of my code, including how I have structured my functions and classes, how I have commented my code, and how I have documented my project in this document.

I have put a lot of effort into this project and I hope that you will find it comprehensive and well-documented. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,
Adam Grabowski
